Here you will find my independent musings about gaming, role playing games (RPGs), Live role playing or Live Action Role Playing (LRP, LARP or LaRP) and game system ideas.

I have been involved in these hobbies for over two decades and although invloved in digital media and digital gaming this is not intended to muse on that subject. Although it will muse greatly on the use of technology in RPGs and LARP.
