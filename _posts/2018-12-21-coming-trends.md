So this post dropped into my path "[The Future of Tech](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ieee-computer-society-predicts-the-future-of-tech-top-10-technology-trends-for-2019-300767876.html)" take a moment to read it, but the TL;DR version is tech is evolving adn body augmentation as become acceptable! 

This discussion brings me back to things that I menat to post and discuss, tracking players, using RFID in game, and RFID tags and player ID, aswell as what tech is acceptable in what settings! I'll come back to all of those in the new year.

So what are the game trends in LaRP for 2019/2020 and beyond. The last few years have seen the rise of Nordic style larp across Europe, the growth of LaRP tourism across the globe and a emergance of higher production value repeated delivery of LaRPs by creative studios. It's also seen commercial entities try and fail to cash in on this (cash in so far that is). So what will the new year bring. 

From the article above I don't think AI is what will paly a part in LaRP, but Internet of the Body (IOB), connected players, clothing and items of street wear open opportunities, and is it time for Google glass to try the market again. 

I think augmentation is where it will play a part, cheap wareable tech, headsets, cameras, data stores and signal emiters. Will we be able to make character cards that emit subsets of data that augment the player experiance. Will this affect theatre style combat and effect usage, magic aplication and health tracking for combat heavy events. 

The limits are limitless, the practicle application only just becoming a consideration. So lets see.
