Minimal Viable Product (MVP), or what is the minimum you need to run or at least propose a game?
is it simply an idea, a concept, or is it a minimum set of rules, a minimal setting document, a minimal set of agreed policies people will abide by.

The nature and idea of Red Circle Games are minimal products, Can we play out the scenario within  the bounds of a red rope light, what would that take.

But how far can you take that! Conventions or cons, play games in the rooms they have available, student halls, hotel dinning halls, school rooms. Small scale LARPs substitute Scout huts for viking long halls , hunting lodges, and even castles in the sky.

Do you need the rules first or will they come, maybe an outline, maybe a statement of intent. And with them the policies that players will adhere to as participants not the rules of the game but the rules such as inclusivity, general behaviours and community practices, what is the minimum of these that should be presented when you initiate a game.

What should be on your webpage do you need a webpage, I strongly think in the modern world you need at least a social presence, whether it is simply a FB page for items of note(RCG as one, it's unpublished) or a full website or something in between on a hosted platform such as Wordpress, blogger or pre packaged template sites like Wix and Squarespace.

So what is your MVP? I know what RCGs is, it's this space, an idea and a page in the projects space.
If I was to run the game, it would also be a Github space for the related documents, and a FB group for the participants. The game concept would define it's Minimal viable site, some ideas (dualing Rozencrantz and Guilistern, I'll tell you more about it later) could take place in any Red Cirle or bar, the bar at the end of time and space ironically will not work in a bar, it needs a night club really. While John Wick inspired, "the Continental" needs, a hotel, or an indoor airsoft venue over several levels, locations. How about your story and event.

I'd like to think this stream of consciousness will give you some food for thought on the subject of your minimal viable game.
