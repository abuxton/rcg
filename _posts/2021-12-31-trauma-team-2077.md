Trauma Team International or TT-2077, a nod to [Treasure Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Trap) and simpler games, and a nod to a genre I adore and a concept I think has legs.

It is not related to this [Trauma team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_Team) but I feel if I dig, the lack of game content for the Trauma Team it is referring to is in some way due to this past art existing in the same medium and the potential for financial and creative havoc is could of caused so I mention for clarity.

It is a reference to the Cyberpunk2077 Trauma Team [https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Trauma_Team](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Trauma_Team) and the Darkhorse Comic of the same material [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077:_Trauma_Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077:_Trauma_Team)

Lets start with some web presence, and some initial ideas.

- Coloured sets; C&C (yellow), Trauma room (red), Transport (blue, green), Missions (back light, stark light and colour sets)
- locations; C&C, Trauma Room, Transports, bunkhouse, training ground, briefing rooms
- Props; TT membership cards, creds, badges & ID, costume, computers, seats and rigs (gun stands, medi stands), medi tank (think banfa tank from Star wars)
- Format; Mission based run outs to recover clients, dungeons with guns, street scenes short fast violent, tense, not always violent, can you run a detective story line through the game
- Story and arc; does it support long term arc, do I want it to.

Ok that will do for a start.
