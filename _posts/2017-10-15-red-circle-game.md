So what is a Red Circle Game? It's an idea, the idea that the minimum you need to play a game is a circle. The minimum you need to play a LaRP is a circle, the boundary to the game.
Why a boundary?  simply because every game needs an start, and an end, and with todays audience a safe place, a way to step into and out of the game whether at the beginning, the middle, or the end, or when you feel that you need to.

That's the simple idea. If you have the game in your head, and you want to play it out a circle is simple, a rope, a hoop, a simple line in the sand pit, or a chalk line on the floor. All these make a circle. A circle is an idea it does not have to be that or a size of any particular size. As long as you can choose to step in, and when to step out. As long as you can choose to bring with you what you need and take away what you wish to it is the circle for the game.

In my head I imagine a convention level event, the same two person scenario distributed to a room of players and all of them provided a simple red circle, paired up to prepare allowed to step in play out and step away as they seem fit. But I also see the boundaries of a field as the red circle for a fest game, you all enter, play, and leave as you need to. Both in their way are our "Red Circle".

Try it out for me, let me know what you think.
