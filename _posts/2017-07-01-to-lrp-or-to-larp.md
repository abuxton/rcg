Live Action Role Play, Interactive Theatre, Fantasy Role Play, a cross country pantomime. What do you call it? how do you write it LRP, or LARP? How do you acronym the phrase?

To me it always seems bizarre how much contention there is between the terms LRP or LARP, is one American and one European? is one what came into popular parlance due to the growth in Lead Replacement Petrol(LRP) which threatened to bury Live Role Play(LRP) on a burgeoning internet.

But if ever their was a hobby that needed a glossary and definitions and to explain it's acronyms alongside it's rules to the ever growing audience of players not from classical RPG backgrounds, then it's L(A)RP.

L(A)RP? Why L(A)RP, in the case of Red Circle Games(RCG, see more acronyms) it's a choice, if you've read here before(I doubt it) you'll even notice I went through the site and made the reference to LRP,LARP consistently L(A)RP. Live Action(optional) Role Playing. I hate the ambiguity with Lead Replacement Petrol, I don't care enough if you think it's action or not. Thus for RCG L(A)RP works. You can make your own mind up which you wan't to use, whether through age, contrary opinion, or some other reason.
