Lockdown tired out and stressed us all, I struggled to create much, or paint models which was one of the few outlets I had left. Then one day in recently I got an itch.

I used to love D&D, I'm a storyteller I've never played for long with out ending uup the GM,DM or storyteller. I'm ok with this. Like everyone who plays I've a half dozen half generated characters at any time, and probably a number of campaign ideas just floating in my head. This is that same itch some people turn into a book, or a blog.

So what happened this time? I don't know I just had a fancy.

- I created a facebook group( no I'm not sharing ), I'll talk about this in a follow up post. I also used Facebook to recruit some players.
-  I created 3 Pintrest boards, one for beginner player resources, one for DM resources, and one for campaign setting resources such as location, characters, and the kind. I'll share these later.
-  I opened a Discord server, and went through roles and channels with groups.
-  I found some useful online resources, map tools, character generation tools.
-  I revisited Roll20 and Foundry Virtual Table Top to facilitate the game.

We'll come back to all these points, in some more posts for my own brain dumps.

So here I am with a campaign idea for Dungeons and Dragons 5E to enable me to blow the dust off of the books I've been shelving once read. It's a bit classic undertaking in Faerun and Forgotten Realms, with the Starter box to kick off and balance the party and drop them into Sword Coast territory, Waterdeep, and Baldurs Gate that will lead into my favourite 3rd party campaign no I'm not spoiling the surprise here.
