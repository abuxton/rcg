It's been a while, I'd stepped away TBH. Lost my lust, and love for this as a creative outfit. But maybe there is one last game left in me. Maybe i'll just stretch my legs, blow some cobwebs out my ears, and let my fingers flex on a keyboard for a few weeks and see what Red Circle games can create.
